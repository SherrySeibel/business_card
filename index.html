        <!--Concept for personal site...I like to have a concrete strategy of what I want to do before embarking on a time-consuming project. The following will outline my idea:-->

        <!--Background: Collage of "Favorite" or "Defining" things. Moving the cursor over a particular image will prompt a small blurb that explains its importance.-->

        <!--Overt summary: There will be an opaque, static, summary box of myself with links to my email and gitHub accounts. The self-summary will be brief; the background will do most of the explaining. The links will be attached to  "buttons" depicting recognizable logos. The font will be fun. I'm currently considering using my own handwriting as the font of choice (There will be back-up fonts embedded to make sure all computers can see the summary). -->

        <!--There MAY be a professional head shot of me.--> 

        <!--This will be an evolving, learning process.-->
